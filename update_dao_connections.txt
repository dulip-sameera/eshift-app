Updated DAO files with using statements for proper connection disposal:

✅ CustomerDaoImpl.cs - COMPLETED
✅ JobDaoImpl.cs - COMPLETED  
✅ LoadDao.cs - Already has using statement

Remaining files to update:
- TransportUnitDaoImpl.cs
- UserDaoImpl.cs  
- VehicleDaoImpl.cs
- StaffDaoImpl.cs
- RoleDaoImpl.cs

All connection variables need to be changed from:
var conn = DatabaseConnection.Instance.Connection;

To:
using var conn = DatabaseConnection.Instance.Connection;

This ensures proper connection disposal and prevents memory leaks.
